# SRH2D-pre-post-processing
Pre- and post-processing for SRH-2D using open source tools
============================================================
What is this repository about?
------------------------------------------------------------
Here are the lecture notes and cases I use for a training course on the SRH-2D model. The aim is to use open source tools to do the pre- and post-processing work for SRH-2D. This is a (free) alternative for other commercial pre/post processing tools for SRH-2D.

SRH-2D, Sedimentation and River Hydraulics â€“ Two-Dimensional model, is a two-dimensional (2D) hydraulics and sediment transport model developed Dr. Yong Lai at the Bureau of Reclamation. You can find more information about SRH-2D at its website: [http://www.usbr.gov/pmts/sediment/model/srh2d/] (http://www.usbr.gov/pmts/sediment/model/srh2d/)

What open source tools used?
-----------------------------------------------------------
0. Preprocessing: Gmsh and scripts written Python and Fortran
1. Postprocessing: Paraview

Who should be interested?
-----------------------------------------------------------
0. Whoever is interested to test out SRH-2D but don't have license for commercial software. 
1. Developers who wants to add more functionalities and have more freedom.
